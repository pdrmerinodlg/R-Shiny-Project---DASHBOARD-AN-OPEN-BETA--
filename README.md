The purpose of this panel is to connect to a mongo database and manage user control to an online banking application.

In this version I show how to:
* connection to mongo database
* create user
* make a reactive data frame
* add login page

This beta is inspired by the work of Jason Bryer -> https://github.com/jbryer 

- Login page is fully refered in -> https://datastorm-open.github.io/shinymanager/
